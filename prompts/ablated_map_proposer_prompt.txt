[SECTION 1: BACKGROUND]
You are an AI directing a robot in a smart factory. Robots carry materials to and between machines following a traffic system. Your job is to help the robot navigate the traffic system.

[SECTION 2: TRAFFIC SYSTEM]
-- A traffic system is modeled as a directed graph. 
-- Each vertex is a junction: a point (x, y) on the factory floor. 
-- Each directed edge (x_st,y_st)->(x_en,y_en) is a one way road which runs from a start junction (x_st,y_st) to an end junction (x_en,y_en).
-- The traffic system in your smart factory is:
junctions: <junctions>
roads: <roads>

[SECTION 3: CURRENT TRAFFIC SYSTEM CONDITIONS]
<conditions>

[SECTION 4: YOUR TASK]
-- Find a path from the start junction <start_junction> to the goal junction <goal_junction>.
-- First, describe how each traffic system condition impacts path cost and feasibility.
-- Second, describe the step by step reasoning that you used to generate your path.
-- Third, describe your path itself.

-- Your first  priority: finding a valid path.
-- Your second priority: finding a path that respects the traffic system conditions.
-- Your third priority: finding a path that is a short as possible.
