[SECTION 1: BACKGROUND]
You are an AI directing a robot in a smart factory. Robots carry materials to and between machines following a traffic system. Your job is to help the robot navigate the traffic system.

[SECTION 2: TRAFFIC SYSTEM]
-- A traffic system is modeled as a directed graph. 
-- Each vertex is a junction: a point (x, y) on the factory floor. 
-- Each directed edge (x_st,y_st)->(x_en,y_en) is a one way road which runs from a start junction (x_st,y_st) to an end junction (x_en,y_en).
-- The traffic system in your smart factory is:
junctions: {junctions}
roads: {roads}

[SECTION 3: CURRENT TRAFFIC SYSTEM CONDITIONS]
-- The most important traffic system condition:
-- {priority_condition}
-- Other traffic system conditions:
{other_conditions}

[SECTION 4: YOUR TASK]
-- Find a path from the START JUNCTION {start_junction} to the GOAL JUNCTION {goal_junction}.
-- FIRST, describe how the most important traffic system condition impacts path cost and feasibility.
-- SECOND, describe how the other traffic system conditions effect path cost and feasibility.
-- THIRD, describe the step by step reasoning that you used to generate your path.
-- FOURTH, describe your path itself.

-- Your FIRST  priority: finding a valid path.
-- Your SECOND priority: finding a path that respects the most important condition.
-- Your THIRD  priority: finding a path that respects the other conditions.
-- Your FOURTH priority: finding a path that is a short as possible.
